#Problem Statement:
~ In ecosystems,animals are essential.However,they are being exposed to unnecessary suffering,agony,and cruelty,which finally
leads to the extinction of the whole species or the death of the animals.There is no such global platform where this problem
may be discussed and voice can be raised against this issue.
