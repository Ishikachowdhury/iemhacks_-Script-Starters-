#Problem Statement:
~ In ecosystems,animals are essential.However,they are being exposed to unnecessary suffering,agony,and cruelty,which finally
leads to the extinction of the whole species or the death of the animals.There is no such global platform where this problem
may be discussed and voice can be raised against this issue.


#Project Installation Setup:

-Project planning:
      [] We start with planning on a project and coming up with the project name and the features it will contain.
      Our planning also contained a rough sketch of how the website should look and function.

   -opening repository and linking Github:    
       [] Next we opened accounts on github and prepared a repository, then linked github with visual studio code and shared access with the teammates.

 -Writing source code:
      [] We started coding and named our source file as index.html. Some errors occured initially but were fixed shortly after one by one. 

 -Collecting data and pictures:
      [] While one worked on source code, the other collected the pictured and data required to bring the website to fruition.  

 -Preparing presentation: 
       [] The source code was still being written and we brought our ideas to reality through a presentation. It also gives a better idea of the project.

   -Inputting pictures and styles: 
     [] The pictures were being inserted in the source file and we faced a problem which was taken care of by our capable members.

     -Preparing style and script: 
     [] We are currently working on two files style.css and script.js to make the website a whole. 
The future updates will be updated on time.
